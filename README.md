# Scalable Epidemic Simulator

A simulator to study the affects of an epidemic (with a heavy focus on COVID-19) with real values as much as possible. The hope is to understand the impact of various mitigation plans introduced by governments in cities. This is inspired from "[Simulating an epidemic](https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs)" video on Youtube.

A colloborative hack project started with [Dhwani](https://github.com/Dhwanibosamiya), [Varsha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varshagopalakrishnan/) and [Alivia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliviablount/)
